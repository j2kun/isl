Here are the regex patterns and patches needed to fix ISL's Bazel build:

## Regex to fix angle bracket includes for local files:

```bash
# Replace ISL local headers with quotes
sed -i -E 's|#include <(isl_[^>]+\.h)>|#include "\1"|g' *.c *.h

# Replace specific local files with quotes  
sed -i -E 's|#include <(gitversion\.h)>|#include "\1"|g' *.c *.h

# Replace template includes with quotes
sed -i -E 's|#include <([^/>]*_templ\.[ch])>|#include "\1"|g' *.c *.h

# Replace included C files with quotes
sed -i -E 's|#include <([a-zA-Z_][^/>]*\.c)>|#include "\1"|g' *.c *.h
```

## Complete build configuration:

The BUILD.bazel configuration needs:

1. Template files in `textual_hdrs` to make them available for inclusion without compilation
2. All private headers in `srcs`
3. All macro and template headers added
4. Remove `-I.` flag (security issue in Bazel)
5. Use quotes for local includes instead of angle brackets

## Status:
- ✅ Regex patterns created and tested
- ✅ Include fixes applied to source files
- ✅ BUILD.bazel configuration updated
- ⚠️  Build still needs all included C files added to textual_hdrs

The fundamental issue is that ISL uses a template-based C inclusion system that doesn't align well with Bazel's compilation model. The angle bracket vs quotes fix resolves the immediate path issues.
